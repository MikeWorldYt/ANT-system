> [!IMPORTANT] 
> **ANT on the system** (Archive Nesting Technique on the System) is a *Hierarchical Organizational Method* designed to streamline the storage, making it easier to manage and find your documents.
<!--
[...]
-->
> #### How works?
> Her rules **organize files in a way that mimics a nested for categories** by following a naming convention and incremental numbering, Where the main categories are at the highest level, and each subsequent level provides more specific subcategories.

### QUICK START
1. [Download the scrip (not avaible yet)](not-available)
2. [Seeing The Rules](#-main-concepts)
3. Let's Organize!
-->
### Key Benefits of ANT System:

1. **Structured Organization:** Files are organized in a clear hierarchical structure, making navigation easy.
2. **Convenient Nomenclature:** Folders and subfolders are named with an incremental and intuitive patern, improving the organization, creation, and search of content.
3. **Clean Desktop:** A special 'Projects' folder serves as a Temporary Repository for current and future projects, eliminating the need to use the desktop for these purposes and keeping clutter-free.
4. **Master Tracking Work/School Projects:** It allows you track ongoing projects and store ideas, When a project is done you'll know it, If you need files from another project you'll know where they are.

Following this method will ensure that your Digital Storage is well-organized, Easily accessible, and Efficiently managed

# 📄 MAIN CONCEPTS
## 1. Levels and Folder's Structure
</div>

Levels refer to the depth within the folder tree directory.

> [!TIP]
> 🛈 The basic structure suggests 3 levels, although in some cases there may be more. However, it is recommended not to have too many levels and to use them only in certain cases.

### 1.1 The Level 1 - Main Categories

<img src="https://github.com/MikeWorldYt/ANT-on-the-system/assets/118069844/9db77e92-f03c-4392-b315-05739024d9e8" alt="ILL_pictures_01" width="350">

> 🛈 Is the highest hierarchy, inside from your Root Storage Folder, content the main categegories;

With an incremental enumeration with three digits (100, 200, 300, ...), followed by a '.', followed by the Main Category name in Capitals

**Usage Suggestions:**

### 1.2 The Levels 2 - Categories, Subjects

<img src="https://github.com/MikeWorldYt/ANT-on-the-system/assets/118069844/4c090700-6138-4a5f-bc90-49b3c896d0b8" alt="ILL_pictures_04" width="350">

> 🛈 Is inside of your main category selectioned;

For each folder add an incremental enumeration with two digits, followed by a '.', followed by the Categories Name

**Usage Suggestions:**

### 1.3 The Levels 3 - Subcategories, Topics or Theme. 
There are two ways to structure, If categories stay for a long time should be use a "Chill Structure", Otherwise if its a temporary data, meaning it'll only be used for a short period, *then* you should use a “control structure”.

#### 1.3.1 Chill Structure

<img src="https://github.com/MikeWorldYt/ANT-on-the-system/assets/118069844/797bbad4-cb0b-4050-b5d6-169050892212" alt="ILL_pictures_07" width="350">

> Is simple, It has an incremental enumeration with two or more digits, tho it doesn't necesary go at the beginning, as it'll depend on the needs/customization of each one. 

Use if:
- You need a static sequence
- The directory is a permanent category

**Usage Suggestions:**

#### 1.3.2 Control Structure
```image_10
> PJ_001(YY-MM-DD)_proyect name
> PP_Category[Topic]_Presentation
> DB_Category[Topic]_database name
```

> It's ideal por projects, presentations, homeworks, etc. Use a naming convetion for controling and easy identification

Use if:
- You Need to have control
- The data is temporary and will most likely be deleted later
- Share with more people if you

**Usage Suggestions:**

### 1.4 Projects Folder
```Structure
📁 003.PROJECTS
│
├── 📁 Brainstorm [Varied Ideas]
├── 📁 Science Fair Ideas
├── 📁 Inspiration Project [by Bill Ready]
├   ...
├── 📁 97.Undefined <-- Support Folder
├── 📁 98.Review <-- Support Folder
├   ...
├── ↗️ 🔗 103.05.MyLargeProject <-- Shortcut
├── ↗️ 🔗 PJ_133_(24-05-12)_My-Project-Name <-- Shortcut
├── ↗️ 🔗 PJ_134_(24-06-01)_My-Little-Project <-- Shortcut
```

> 🛈 Works as a temporal repository, It should contentain shortcuts to current project paths, and If you want also idea or inspiration folders


<div align="center">

## 2. Support Folders
</div>

> 🛈 The support folders in that sense should provide help at the current level.

These have a unique enumeration that helps them not to mix with other files and to be ordered in a way that they can be quickly identified.

### 2* 2.1 Settings Folder (99)
Its unique enumeration is '99', so you will find it as '99.Settings'.
This folder contains general configurations for both the 'ANT System', Your programs, interfaces, and Operating System.

These can be graphic customizations like wallpapers or configurations such as Network settings or Registry.

!!! Notes:Parameters for Software

### 2.2 Review Folder (98)
Its unique enumeration is '98', so you will find it as '98.Review'.
!!! To edit)

### 2.3 Undefined Folder (97)
Its unique enumeration is '97', so you will find it as '97.UnDefined' or 97.UnCategorized'.
!!! To edit)

### 2.4 Resources Folder (90)
Its unique enumeration is '90', so you will find it as '90.Resources'.
!!! To edit)

### 2.5 Archive Folder (00)
Its unique enumeration is '00', so you will find it as '00.Archive'.
!!! To edit)
